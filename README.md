# Miking-LSP
A Miking Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation

The goals of the Miking-LSP project are to:

* Implement the [LSP](https://langserver.org/) protocol in MCore.

* Implement an LSP language server for Miking in MCore.

* Provide IDE features for both the Miking Core language itself and user-created
  DSLs using the server.

[Miking](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking/) repo to install Miking along
